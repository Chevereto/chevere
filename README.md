This is the Chevere Framework for building pluggable server-side applications intended to be implemented in the context of [PHP](https://www.php.net/) application runners.

Chevere is the custom-made tailored framework that powers the next-gen [Chevereto V4](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto) and it was entirely designed around the existing needs and goals of [Chevereto V3](https://chevereto.com/pricing) and [Chevereto-Free](https://github.com/Chevereto/Chevereto-Free) users.

The project is still under development and using it in production is highly experimental.
